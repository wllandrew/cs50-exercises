# CS50x 2025

This repository contains all of my solutions for the problems set / challenges in the cs50x 2025 course. CS50 is an introduction to computer science class by Harvard University. These problem sets are exercises / homework for each week of the course and necessary for completing the course.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Acaemic Honesty

If you are currently taking CS50, keep in mind the course's academic honesty policy. You should figure it out the solutions to all problem sets by yourself, and only then use repositories like this to compare answer and craft better solutions.
