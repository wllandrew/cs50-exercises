# CS50x 2025

This repository contains all of my solutions for the problems set / challenges in the cs50x 2025 course. CS50 is an introduction to computer science class by Harvard University. These problem sets are exercises / homework for each week of the course and necessary for completing the course.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Acaemic Honesty

If you are currently taking CS50, keep in mind the course's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/honesty/">academic honesty policy</a>. You should figure it out the solutions to all problem sets by yourself, and only then use repositories like this to compare answer and craft better solutions.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Most of these solutions use special libraries given by the CS50's staff to make some functionalities easier to introduce, and also most of these files need other files given by the code distribution, so don't expect to compile any of this by itself and to work. Only by using the distributed code in the problem set page and making sure you have the right dependencies can you expect your code to run properly. 

## üìö Structure 

There are 10 problem sets, one for each week starting at week 0. In total, there are 27 problems.

### 0Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 0

This week introduces the concepts of computational thinking, algorithms and problems solving in computer science.

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/0/scratch/">Starting from scratch</a>: implementing a interactive script in scratch. See my game <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1116992942/">here</a>.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 1

This week introduces the basics of programming and the C language.

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/me/">Hello, it's me</a>: simple C script thats print a dynamic hello.
2. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/mario/more/">Mario (More)</a>: C script that emulates triangular structures like the ones in <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario">Mario games</a>.
3. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/1/credit/">Credit</a>: C script that implements a credit card validation algorithm.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 2

This week introduces the basics of arrays and compiling.

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/2/scrabble/">Scrabble</a>: C script that calculates the score for a certain word in a <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrabble">Scrabble</a> game.
2. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/2/readability/">Readabiity</a>: C script that calculates the "reading level" for a sentence, based on the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/2/readability/">Coleman-Liau Index</a>.
3. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/2/substitution/">Substitution</a>: C script that encrypts a sentence when given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher">substitution cypher</a>.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 3

This week presents the most famous searching and sorting algorithms.

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/">Sort</a>: by using certaing sorting scripts in different files that are a sequence of number, you need to analyse and find out which script implements which sorting algorithm.
2. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/plurality/">Plurality</a>: C script that emulates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting">plurality voting system</a>.
3. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/3/tideman/">Tideman</a>: C script that emulates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs">ranked pairs voting system</a> (a.k.a. Tideman).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 4

This week introduces the concepts of memory, stack, heap, pointers and I/O operations.

1. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/4/volume/">Volume</a>: C script that modifies the volume of a <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAV">WAV</a> file.
2. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/4/filter/more/">Filter (More)</a>: C script that can apply grayscale, blur, reflection and edge-detection filters in a <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/4/filter/more/">BMP</a> image.
3. <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/4/recover/">Recover</a>: C script that "recovers" deleted <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> images from a memory card.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ - Week 5
